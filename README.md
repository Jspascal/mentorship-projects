# 🚀 Projects Specifications 🚀

Welcome to the projects specifications repository! This is where you can find the details and requirements for the awesome projects that you will be working on as a trainee. Each trainee has a folder with their name, where they can access the specifications for their assigned projects.

## 📝 Instructions 📝

To work on a project, you need to follow these steps:

- 🆕 Create a new repository on GitHub with the name of the project. This will be your personal workspace where you will store your code and track your progress.
- 💻 Clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a copy of the repository on your computer, where you can edit and test your code.
- 🔀 Initialize git flow by running git flow init and following the prompts. This will set up a branching model that will help you organize your work and collaborate with others.
- 🔒 Protect the master branch on GitHub by going to Settings > Branches > Add rule and selecting master as the branch name pattern. Check the options "Require pull request reviews before merging" and "Include administrators". This will ensure that the master branch is always stable and up-to-date with the latest version of the project.
- 🌱 Create a new feature branch for each task or functionality of the project by running git flow feature start <feature-name>. This will create a separate branch where you can work on a specific feature without affecting the rest of the project.
- 💾 Work on the feature branch and commit your changes regularly. This will save your work and keep track of your changes.
- 🚀 When the feature is done, push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request to merge it to the develop branch. Request a review from your mentor or another trainee. This will allow others to check your code and give you feedback before merging it to the main branch.
- 🗑️ After the pull request is approved and merged, delete the feature branch locally and remotely. This will keep your repository clean and avoid confusion.
- 🔁 Repeat steps 5 to 8 for each feature until the project is complete. You can also check the specifications folder for more guidance and tips on each feature.
- 🏷️ When the project is ready for release, create a release branch by running git flow release start <version-number>. This will create a branch where you can prepare the project for deployment.
- 📈 Bump the version number in the project files and commit the changes. This will indicate that this is a new version of the project with new features and improvements.
- 🎁 Push the release branch to GitHub and create a pull request to merge it to the master branch. Request a review from your mentor or another trainee. This will finalize the release and update the master branch with the new version of the project.
- ✅ After the pull request is approved and merged, tag the master branch with the version number by running git tag <version-number>. This will mark the master branch with a label that shows which version it is.
- 🌐 Push the tag to GitHub by running git push origin <version-number>. This will make the tag visible on GitHub and allow others to download or clone that specific version of the project.
- ⬇️ Merge the master branch to the develop branch by running git checkout develop and git merge master. This will sync the develop branch with the master branch and make sure they are both up-to-date.
- ⬆️ Push the develop branch to GitHub by running git push origin develop. This will update the develop branch on GitHub and make it ready for new features.
- 🗑️ Delete the release branch locally and remotely. This will keep your repository clean and avoid confusion.
- 🎉 Congratulations, you have completed the project! 🎉 You should be proud of yourself for creating something amazing! 😊
