# Branching Strategy

Git flow is a popular Git branching strategy that aims to simplify release management and collaboration among developers. It was introduced by Vincent Driessen in 2010 and has been widely adopted by many software teams since then.

Git flow involves using different types of branches for different purposes, such as developing new features, preparing releases, and fixing bugs. By following a consistent naming convention and workflow, Git flow helps to keep the Git history clean and organized, and to avoid conflicts and confusion.

## The Main Branches: Master and Develop

The main branches in Git flow are master and develop. The master branch contains the production-ready code that can be deployed at any time. The develop branch contains the pre-production code that has the latest features and changes, but may not be stable or tested enough for deployment.

The master branch is created at the start of the project and is maintained throughout the development process. The develop branch is also created at the start of the project, branching off from master, and is updated regularly by merging other branches into it.

## The Supporting Branches: Feature, Release, and Hotfix

The supporting branches in Git flow are feature, release, and hotfix. These branches are used to isolate different types of work from the main branches, and are usually short-lived and deleted after they are merged.

- Feature branches are used to develop new features or enhancements for the project. They are created from the develop branch and merged back into it when the feature is completed and reviewed.
- Release branches are used to prepare new releases of the project. They are created from the develop branch and merged into both main and develop when the release is ready for deployment. Release branches may include minor bug fixes or adjustments specific to the release.
- Hotfix branches are used to fix urgent bugs or issues in the master branch. They are created from the master branch and merged into both master and develop when the fix is verified.

## How to Use Git Flow

Git flow is not a built-in feature of Git, but rather a convention or a guideline that can be followed manually or with the help of tools. There are several tools that can help you implement Git flow in your project, such as:

- git-flow: A command-line tool that extends Git with subcommands for Git flow operations.
- GitKraken: A graphical user interface (GUI) tool that supports Git flow with a visual representation of the branches and actions.
- GitHub Desktop: A GUI tool that integrates with GitHub and allows you to create feature branches with one click.

To use Git flow in your project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your repository with master and develop branches.
2. Create a feature branch from develop whenever you start working on a new feature or enhancement.
3. Commit your changes regularly to your feature branch and push them to the remote repository.
4. When your feature is done, create a pull request to merge your feature branch into develop. Review your code and resolve any conflicts or issues before merging.
5. Delete your feature branch after it is merged into develop.
6. When you are ready to release a new version of your project, create a release branch from develop. Give it a meaningful name, such as v1.0 or release-1.0.
7. Test your release branch thoroughly and make any necessary adjustments or bug fixes.
8. Create a pull request to merge your release branch into master. Tag your commit with a version number or a release name.
9. Create another pull request to merge your release branch into develop. This will ensure that any changes made in the release branch are also reflected in the develop branch.
10. Delete your release branch after it is merged into both master and develop.
11. If you discover a critical bug or issue in the master branch that needs to be fixed immediately, create a hotfix branch from master.
    Give it a descriptive name, such as hotfix-login-error or hotfix-1.0.1.
12. Fix the bug or issue in your hotfix branch and commit your changes.
13. Create a pull request to merge your hotfix branch into master. Tag your commit with an updated version number or release name.
14. Create another pull request to merge your hotfix branch into develop. This will ensure that any changes made in the hotfix branch are also reflected in the develop branch.
15. Delete your hotfix branch after it is merged into both master and develop.
